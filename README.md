# AmazonBooksMini
Simplified version of [AmazonBooks](https://github.com/4gus71n/AmazonBooks)

## Main changes:
First I use less libraries in this version. I use Gson to turn the Json response into objects. I use Ion as my Http client because It has an easy to use API. I'm using Glide to get the images from the URLs. And I'm using the support libraries to use the RecyclerView.
No fancy architecture, prioritized coding time over quality and architecture development. Just used a plain old Android App architecture.
